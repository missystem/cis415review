* Execute user programs
* Make solving user problems easier
* Make the computer system covenient to use
* Use the computer hardware in an efficient manner

Computer System Structure:
* Hardware
	- provides basic computing resources
	* CPU, memory, I/O devices
* Operating system
	* controls and coordinates use of hardware among various applications and users
* Application programs
* Users
